# face-recognition

This is an IoT face-recognition application. This app consists of two parts: a camera-server and a recognition-client. Thanks to **Kirk Kaiser**(https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/poor-mans-deep-learning-camera/) and **Miguel Grinberg**(https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming). The server is based on their work.
